# Swarm

In omp, read [the omp adapter](../../docs/harness/omp.md) once per session before you follow this skill. It maps the upstream names in the bundled skills to omp.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Pick the worker model from the `swarm workers` line in `~/.omp/agent/RULES.md`. If the rule or that line is missing, use `the stack_code role selector`. If the role line is missing, omit `model` so the workers run on the session model. If omp rejects a selector, use the role's approved fallback and say so; do not substitute a different family silently. For a model race, name each arm's model up front. Pick each subagent's reasoning level and fast or standard speed for the job, per the Subagents section of the **poteto-mode** skill.
4. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers in one message with `agent: task`, `isolated: true`, background execution (the default), and the step 3 model, left unset when the role line is missing (the session model). Use a local, non-isolated run only when the worker needs access to something on the user's computer.

When a worker must start from a non-default pushed branch, pass `cloud_base_branch`.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with a result table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
